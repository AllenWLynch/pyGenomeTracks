# if the type=genes is given

# file. If the bed file contains the exon
# structure (bed 12) then this is plotted. Otherwise
# a region **with direction** is plotted.
# if the bed file contains a column for color (column 9), then this color can be used by
# setting:
# color = bed_rgb
color = darkblue
#if color is a valid colormap name (like RbBlGn), then the score is mapped
# to the colormap. If the color is simply a color name, then this color is used and the score is not considered.
# For the colormap option, the the min_value and max_value for the score can be provided, otherwise
# the maximum score and minimum score found are used.

# the display parameter defines how the bed file is plotted.
# The options are ['colapsed', 'interleaved', 'triangles'] This options asume that the regions do not overlap.
# `collapsed`: The bed regions are plotted one after the other in one line.
# `interleaved`: The bed regions are plotted in two lines, first up, then down, then up etc.
# `triangles`: The bed regions are plotted as triangles, like Hi-C TADs.
# if display is not given, then each region is plotted using the gene style
#optional, default is black. To remove the background color, simply set 'color' and 'background color' to the
# same value
#border color = black
# style to plot the genes when they have exon information
#style = UCSC
#style = flybase
# maximum number of gene rows to be plotted. This
# field is useful to limit large number of close genes
# to be printed over many rows. When several images want
# to be combined this must be set to get equal size, otherwise, on each image the height of each gene changes
#gene rows = 10
# by default the ymax is the number of
# rows occupied by the genes in the region plotted. However,
# by setting this option, the global maximum is used instead.
# This is useful to combine images that are all consistent and
# have the same number of rows.
