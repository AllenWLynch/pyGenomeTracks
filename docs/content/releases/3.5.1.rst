3.5.1
=====

Bugfixes:
^^^^^^^^^

- Get a message when bedtools is installed instead of crashing without any message.

- Always test if a bedgraph is tabix indexed without checking the extension

- Fix a bug which was happening when ``operation`` or ``summary_method`` was used on bedgraph whereas the bedgraph had some missing intervals.
