3.5.2
=====

Dependencies with conda:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Using conda which is the way we recommand installation it is now possible to use python 3.8 and any version of matplotlib from 3.1.1 to 3.3.2.

Bugfixes:
^^^^^^^^^

- When the ``--fontSize`` parameter was used it happened that the colorbar labels were not corresponding to the colorbar ticks. This bug has been fixed.

- The colormap ``pink`` were not working because it was both the name of a color and a colormap. This bug has been fixed.]
