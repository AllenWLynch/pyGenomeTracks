3.5.2
=====

Python dependency with conda:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Using conda which is the way we recommand installation it is now possible to use Python 3.8.

Relax version control on matplotlib:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Any version of matplotlib from 3.1.1 to 3.3.2 is now accepted.

Bugfixes:
^^^^^^^^^

- When the ``--fontSize`` parameter was used it happened that the colorbar labels were not corresponding to the colorbar ticks. This bug has been fixed.

- The colormap ``pink`` were not working because it was both the name of a color and a colormap. This bug has been fixed.]
