3.7.1
=====

Bugfix:
^^^^^^^

- Support mcool files for hic_matrix_square. This solves `#404 <https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks/issues/404>`_

- Works with gffutils version 0.11.0 where ValueError became gffutils.exceptions.EmptyInputError for empty gtf.

- Fixed a small bug in links track with "use_middle" enabled, where midpoints could have different ordering than start points (Thanks to @Jeff1995 ).

Forgotten announcement for 3.7
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pyGenomeTracks now have a `vhighlight` to be able to hightlight a whole region across all tracks.
See the `example <https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks/blob/3.7/pygenometracks/tests/test_data/master_vhighlight.png>`_ with the corresponding `ini file <https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks/blob/3.7/pygenometracks/tests/test_data/vhighlight.ini>`_.
